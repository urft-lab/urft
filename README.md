# URFT
URFT (Unified Resonant Field Theory) is a symbolic-unified field theory developed by Ace Youm, proposing that resonance is the fundamental interaction governing physical, cognitive, and emotional systems. It introduces new physical constructs such as the Dyne, Symbolic Collapse, and a Universal Coupling Constant across dimensions of presence.
