#  Unified Resonant Field Theory (URFT) by Ace Youm
Welcome to the official repository of URFT, a symbolic Theory of Everything
URFT (Unified Resonant Field Theory) is a symbolic-unified field theory developed by Ace Youm, proposing that resonance is the fundamental interaction governing physical, cognitive, and emotional systems. It introduces new physical constructs such as the Dyne, Symbolic Collapse, and a Universal Coupling Constant across dimensions of presence.

# Ultimate Vision of URFT

**Core Identity:**  
**Mathematics = Physics = Computer Science**  
A single inevitable structure from which all three domains emerge as aspects of the same underlying reality.

---

## Guiding Principles
- **No Free Parameters**  
  All constants and laws are derivable exactly from the foundational axioms; nothing is tuned.
- **Total Verifiability**  
  Every conjecture, derivation, and physical phenomenon is verifiable by running code instantly.
- **No Hidden Mechanisms**  
  The full structure is open, transparent, and calculable with exact mathematical precision.

---

## Practical Power
- **Computational Speed, Physical Accuracy**  
  The framework is both a rigorous mathematical theory and an executable model, enabling predictions that are as precise as formal proofs, yet computable in real time.
- **Real-Life Impact**  
  Predictions are not abstract: they connect directly to measurable physical phenomena, from quantum systems to cosmology.

## Democratization of Knowledge
We break down the barriers between:
- Advanced mathematics
- Theoretical physics
- The foundations of computer science

By providing tools, code, and clear derivations, **anyone** â€” not just specialists â€” can explore, test, and expand the theory.

## Vision Statement
The Unified Resonant Field Theory completes the centuries-long unification project:  
- Newton unified celestial and terrestrial mechanics.  
- Maxwell unified electricity, magnetism, and light.  
- Einstein unified space, time, and gravity.  
- The Standard Model unified the electroweak and strong forces.  

**URFT unifies all of these with mathematics and computation â€” closing the loop of knowledge, eliminating contingency, and making the deepest laws of nature accessible to all.**
